# VIP Lounge — Privacy Policy

Last updated: 14 August 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how VIP Lounge ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.

## 1) Information We Collect

- **Account Information (Firebase Auth)**
  - Email/phone and basic profile details you provide to create or sign in to your account.
- **Push Notifications (APNs/FCM)**
  - Device push tokens to deliver notifications.
- **Calendar Access (iOS EventKit)**
  - With your explicit permission, we create calendar events for bookings you choose to add. We do not read your existing calendar contents.
- **Location (When In Use, optional)**
  - If enabled, we use approximate or precise location to show nearby lounges and improve booking context. Location is not collected in the background unless you explicitly enable features that require it.
- **App Diagnostics and Usage**
  - Crash logs and basic usage analytics may be collected by Apple/Google/Firebase services to improve stability and performance. No payments or in‑app purchases are processed in the App.

## 2) How We Use Information

- Provide core features (authentication, bookings, notifications)
- Show relevant content (e.g., nearby locations if enabled)
- Create calendar entries only when you request it
- Maintain and improve the App (debugging, analytics, crash reports)

## 3) Data Sharing

- **Service Providers**: We may share minimal data with vendors who help us operate the App (e.g., Firebase for authentication, messaging, analytics).
- **Legal**: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and users.
- We do not sell personal data.

## 4) Your Choices

- **Permissions**: You can grant or revoke permissions (Location, Calendar, Notifications) in iOS Settings at any time.
- **Notifications**: Disable in iOS Settings > Notifications if you prefer not to receive push notifications.
- **Account**: Contact us to request access, correction, or deletion, subject to legal requirements.

## 5) Data Retention and Security

- We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above or as required by law.
- We implement reasonable safeguards to protect data, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 6) Children’s Privacy

- The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 7) International Transfers

- Your information may be processed and stored in countries outside your country of residence, where data protection laws may differ.
